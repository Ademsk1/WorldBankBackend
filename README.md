# WorldBankBackend
Backend for World Bank data website.
User information is stored in a PSQL database, including their username, 
password. This is linked to another table consisting of History, and 
another with the type of user accessing the site. The PSQL will be hosted 
on Heroku, alongside a Python script that is able to create/store user 
details, and their history.
